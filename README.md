# Colorisfun


I'm tired of guessing at tailwind colors, so this is a macOS menubar application that lets you pick 
colors from your screen and shows:

  - Nearest Tailwind CSS color
  - RGB values
  - HSL values
  - Hex code

It is not the fanciest color picker. It will not replace your favorite color picker. 
But it does show tailwind colors (or at least lets you pick from the default) -- includes
Tailwind v3 color palette. .

## Features

  - Lives in your menubar for easy access
  - Pick colors from anywhere on your screen
  - Copy color values to clipboard with a single click
  - Identifies the closest Tailwind CSS color

## Requirements

  - macOS 11.0+
  - Xcode 12.5+
  - Swift 5.5+

## Installation

  1. Clone this repository
  2. Open the project in Xcode
  3. Build and run the application
